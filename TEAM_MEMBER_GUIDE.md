# Team Member Quick Guide

## Welcome to the Onboarding Tracker!

This guide will help you log your onboarding sessions quickly and easily.

## Logging In

1. Go to the Onboarding Tracker website
2. Enter your email address (provided by your manager)
3. Enter your password (provided by your manager)
4. Click "Sign In"

## Logging an Onboarding Session

Once you're logged in, you'll see a simple form:

### Step 1: Enter Client Name
Type the name of the client you did the onboarding session with.

### Step 2: Enter Account Number
Type the account number for this client.

### Step 3: Select Date
- The date defaults to today
- Click the date field to change it if needed
- Select the date when the onboarding session actually happened

### Step 4: Add Notes (Optional)
- Add any important details or reminders about the session
- Examples: "Client asked about feature X", "Follow-up needed", etc.
- This field is optional - leave it blank if not needed

### Step 5: Submit
Click the "Log Session" button to save your entry.

## What Happens Next?

- Your submission is saved instantly
- It appears in your "Recent Sessions" list below the form
- Your manager can see it in the master calendar
- The session status starts as "pending" and may be updated by your manager

## Your Performance Stats

At the top of your dashboard, you'll see quick stats:
- **Today**: Sessions logged today
- **This Month**: Total sessions this month
- **All Time**: Total sessions you've ever logged
- **Streak**: Consecutive days with sessions (keep it going!)
- **Most Frequent Client**: Which client you work with most

These stats update automatically as you log sessions.

## Viewing Your Sessions

Below the submission form, you'll see your 10 most recent sessions, showing:
- Client name
- Account number
- Session number (automatically tracked)
- Date of the session
- Current status (pending, completed, etc.)
- Your notes (if you added any)

## Session Status Meanings

- **Pending**: Session logged, waiting for review
- **Completed**: Session confirmed as completed
- **Cancelled**: Session was cancelled
- **Rescheduled**: Session was moved to a different date
- **No Show**: Client didn't attend

Note: You can log sessions, but only your manager can update the status.

## Syncing to Google Sheets

Your sessions automatically sync to Google Sheets when you submit them. However, if you want to manually sync all your sessions:

1. Look for the **"Sync to Sheets"** button at the top of your Recent Sessions
2. Click the button
3. Wait for the sync to complete (you'll see a spinning icon)
4. A success message will appear when done

**When to use manual sync:**
- You want to make sure all your sessions are backed up
- Auto-sync failed and you want to retry
- You're preparing for a report or review

## Tips

✅ **Log sessions as soon as possible** after they happen
✅ **Double-check the account number** before submitting
✅ **Use the correct date** - especially if logging past sessions
✅ **Check your recent sessions** to verify your entries
